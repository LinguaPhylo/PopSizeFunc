/**
 * Represents a logistic growth model.

 * - t50 corresponds to the inflection point of the curve, similar to t50 in the Gompertz model, indicating the time at which the population reaches half of its carrying capacity.
 * - L is analogous to NInfinity in the Gompertz model, representing the carrying capacity or the maximum achievable population size.
 * - b is related to the growth rate parameter b in the Gompertz model, determining the steepness of the curve.
